## How object-oriented concepts were used to develop the game

## How linked lists/stacks/queues play a role in the game
We have a total of 3 linked lists and 1 stack implemented in the program.
1. One linked list overloaded by multiple member functions to manage the game inventory and team.
- It provides functionality to append new nodes (characters or inventory items) to the list, search for specific nodes, remove nodes, and print the contents of the list.
  
2. One linked list to manage the storyline in the game.
- Each node of the linked list represents a chapter in the game's story.
- Allowing easy traversal and retrieval of specific chapters as needed.
  
3. One linked list is used to implement the shop inventory system in the game.
- Serves as a data structure to store and manage the available items in the shop.
- Each node in the linked list represents an item, and the next pointer connects the nodes to form a chain.
- Provides a user interface for players to browse and purchase items from the shop.

4. A stack is used as part of the game's battle system.
- Stores the enemy characters that the player will face.
- Each time a new enemy appears, it is added to the stack using the push function.
- The player defeats enemies by using the pop function to remove the top enemy from the stack.
